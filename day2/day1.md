#### 1.2 Basic Neural Network example: Housing price prediction
- x: input (size, #bedrooms, zipcode, wealth) 
- y: result (house price)
- neural network: stacked neurons

x -> neural network -> y

Given enough data for training x and y, neural network are remarkly good at figuring out functions that accurately map from x to y

#### 1.3 Data Source

- Structured data: Database 
- Unstructured data: Audio, Image, Text

#### 1.4 Scale drives deep learning progress

- Scale of the data and size of the neural network
- It takes a lot of time to train a netonly in large data area, neural network performs better than other approaches

Data, computation, Algorithms
- Change algorithm make computation faster  
         
- idea -> code -> experiment -> idea
